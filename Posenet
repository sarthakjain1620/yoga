I tried installing posenet using the github repo given in the pdf as well as finding the method of installation for posenet.

Unfortunately, my system was not able to install posenet even after multiple attempts.

As a result, I was not able to make the model and calculate accuracy using posenet.

It would be a great help if you consider the model made by me and take decision solely on the model.
